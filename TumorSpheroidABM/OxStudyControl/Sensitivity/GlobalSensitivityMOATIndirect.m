% This algorithm is an adaptation of the method of Sensitivity Analysis
% called the Morris method.
%
% Sensitivity analysis is used to estimate the influence of uncertainty
% factors on the output of a function.
% The Morris method is sometimes referenced to as a qualitative method : it
% gives rough estimations with a limited number of calculations.
% The Morris method can be used to simplify a function, as a first step. It
% can identify the factors with a low influence which can be fixed.

% This algorithm reduces the risk to underestimate and fix non-negligible
% factors. It is presented in:

% This program is divided in 6 parts:
% 1) Clearing the memory
% 2) Parameters : Please fill in
% 3) Initialization of the variables
% 4) Loop
% 5) Output text
% 6) Figure
%
% Please fill in the second part to apply the algorithm to your function.
% Do not change the parameters to see the results with the "modified Sobol
% test function".
%
% This program outputs a figure as well as a short summary in the console.
% Consider fixing the factors which appear as negligible on the left of the
% figure (not necessary all the factors under the limit).
%% 2) Parameters : Please fill in
% Maximum number of simulation runs :
% Large number = better estimation of the influence of the factors
% Recommended value : (number of factors + 1) * 10
% The algorithm will maybe exceed this value if it is considered necessary

% Function studied :
% Replace test_function by the name of your function. It must be a 
% function with one multidimensional input x. x must represent the values 
% of the uncertainty factors in the quantiles hyperspace (the i-th 
% coordinate of x is not the actual value of the i-th factor, but the 
% corresponding value of the cumulative distribution function of the i-th 
% factor). To adapt your function, first calculate the actual values of 
% the factors by applying the inverse of their cumulative distribution 
% function to each coordinate of x; Matlab includes such inverses: 
% mathworks.com/help/stats/icdf.html ).
