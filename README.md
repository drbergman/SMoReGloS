# SMoRe GloS

A repository for the paper "An efficient and flexible framework for inferring global sensitivity of agent-based model parameters".
The code here represents the first implementation of Surrogate Modeling for Recapitulating Global Sensitivity (SMoRe GloS) for agent-based models.

# Project Structure
The code for running SMoRe GloS is located in the `src` directory.
The two use cases demonstrated in the paper are located in the `TumorSpheroidABM` and `VascularABM` directories.
The use case directories include README files with instructions on how to run the code.
